=============

For now we are using cestastanford for versioning of all of the CESTA sites using ockham.  

Our workflow is:
- maintain content for each site locally
- build _site locally
- push to a stanford.edu domain
- push files to github for versioning


We are storing all of the _data files here in a separate respository _data.  
You can update those files directly through the github interface. 
Download the updated repository and add it to your site repository. Then build...
